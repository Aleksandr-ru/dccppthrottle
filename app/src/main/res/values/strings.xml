The physical smoke output from the generator is governed by PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) which is controlled by CV133. When the locomotive moves, the function output receives 100% of the PWM signal. The locomotive motor can be stopped for 0–15 seconds (startup delay) so that the smoke generator heats up when the locomotive is stationary. After the delay, the locomotive starts, and the output is activated to a full 100%. At this point the smoke output is fully controlled by PWM. When the load on the locomotive increases, the PWM adjusts the smoke output again to reflect the heavier load. The required load threshold can be set by the user.</string>

With the appropriate settings, the decoder will automatically shut off current to a coupler drive without having to shut off the drive via the function key. Also, the decoder uses an adjustable high PWM to ensure that the coupler drive is only activated for a moment to raise the coupler loop. After the loop is raised, only a small amount of current is needed to keep it in the raised position. The lower PWM and required hold time are adjustable. If the coupler does not couple or uncouple properly on the first attempt, the decoder can be programmed to make several more attempts. When adjusting coupling/uncoupling processes, the „as many as necessary; as few as possible“ rule applies. To prevent the coupler windings from burning up from constant current, an automatic shut-off time must be entered in 0.1 second increments, where the coupler drive will pause before carrying out another coupling operation.</string>

        A switching (shunting) tango can only be carried out if the electric coupler control is activated in CV124 – 129. A switching tango is activated by one of the electric coupler outputs when the decoder speed step is at 0:
        \nHow a switching (shunting) tango works:
        \n1. The locomotive travels forward for a programmable length and speed (T1)
        \n2. The locomotive stops and switches its direction of travel
        \n3. The locomotive uncouples and moves backward at the same speed for the same length (T2)
        \n4. The locomotive stops and resumes the original direction of travel.
    </string>
    <string name="label_xp4_shunting_tango3">Switching tango with automatic coupling and uncoupling</string>
    <string name="label_xp4_shunting_tango4">
        Changing the function operation with two connected couplings on two outputs:
        \n\n1. For the front coupler drive, CV129 is the least significant CV for outputs A1 to A7. So, if A1 and A2 are both used, A1 is for the front coupler and A2 is for the rear coupler. If more (or less) than 2 outputs are used, there is still no difference in the sequence for the different directions of travel (see automatic uncoupling movements).
        \n\n2. If the locomotive is traveling forward and the front coupler drive is deactivated via a function key, the coupler drive is also deactivated when the direction of travel is reversed, and the locomotive is running in an automatic switching (shunting) sequence (coupling procedure). If the locomotive is traveling backwards and the rear coupler drive is deactivated, then the front coupler is activated. In either direction of travel, the electric coupler drive is controlled by its respective setting.
        \n\n3. The amount of time that the electric coupler drive is activated is adjusted via CVs 124–127 to correspond with the switching (shunting) tango scenario, controlled by CVs 136 and 137. The following rule applies: CV124 multiplied with the sum of CV125 + CV126 + CV127 always must be bigger than the sum of CV136 + CV137. In this case and in other circumstances, additions must be made to the right side of the inequality, because, when the model is running in a switching tango mode, the decoder only reverses the direction of travel when it senses the model is in idle.

        Digital couplers are made of the finest copper wire windings and are used for automatically coupling and uncoupling cars. These are generally sensitive to continuous current flow, as they become relatively hot as a result. With appropriate settings, the decoder can ensure that the function outputs are automatically deactivated after a set time (CV130).
        \nAutomatically switch off without having to deactivate the function key. Furthermore, the decoder can ensure that the coupler is only controlled with a high PWM for a brief moment of activation to safely raise the coupler. After this moment, less energy is required to keep the coupler raised. This lower PWM can be set in CV 135.

        \n\nHow a shunting tango works during the uncoupling process: If the car is coupled to the rear coupling, for example, the locomotive must be facing forward in the direction of travel.
        \n1. Locomotive travels at an adjustable speed for an adjustable time T1 against the current direction of travel (press, coupling released)
        \n2. Locomotive stops and changes direction
        \n3. Uncoupling process and the locomotive runs at the same speed level for an adjustable time T2 (moving away)
        \n4. The locomotive stops and now the locomotive has returned to its original direction of travel.
